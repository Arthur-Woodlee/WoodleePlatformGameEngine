  <h1>Platform Game Engine</h1>
  <p>
    This repository contains foundational types and components used to build a 2D platform game.
  </p>
  <p>
    ⚠️ This implementation has been superseded by a new repository: <strong><a href="https://github.com/your-username/Platformer">Platformer</a></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new repo is a reimplementation of this engine, designed to follow a clearer workflow. It introduces:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Progressive onboarding documentation to improve developer understanding</li>
    <li>GitHub workflows for continuous integration (CI)</li>
    <li>Unit testing from the beginning</li>
    <li>Cleaner architecture and modularity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This repo remains available for reference, but active development has moved to <a href="https://github.com/your-username/Platformer">Platformer</a>.
